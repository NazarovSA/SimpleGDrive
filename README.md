SimpleGDrive
============
Qt based client for Google Drive.

Disclaimer
==========
This isn't finished software. Use only at one's own risk. Developing is going under Ubuntu Linux, so I know nothing about
operability under other operating systems.

Facilities
==========
At that moment programm is supporting synchronization "Drive to local folder". Also it has simple GUI which is displaying files
tree with last modified dates. Full synchronization support is coming.

Requirements
============
	- Qt 5.0 or higher
	- C++ compiler supporting the C++11 standard
